    changes:
      - replace the definition of x with:
        + (ty[b])* if x is ty*
        + ty[n/b][b] if x is ty[n]
        in both cases: define ty[b] as block_name
      - add a copy of each function taking an argument of type x and replace the
        function calls with these copies
      - replace array accesses a[i] for a of type x with a[i/b][i%b]
