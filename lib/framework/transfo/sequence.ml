(** [intro ~start ~stop ~nb ~on ~mark ~visible]: this is a high level function for inserting a subsequnece
    inside another sequence.
     [start] - denotes the target for the starting point of the sub-sequence, it should be used in conjunction with
              [nb] or [end].
     [end] - denotes the target for the end point of the sub-sequnece, it should be used in conjunction with
             [nb] or [start].
    [nb] - in the case when the user does not give the target of  the end point of the sequence he can give as
      argument the number of instruction to include comming after [start] or [end]. If used with [start] the sign
      of [nb] should be poistive otherwise it should be negative.
    [on] - denotes a single target to be isolated inside the sub-sequence. When [on] is used all the other
      except mark and visible shoold be left empty. *)

      then it will introduce a sequence that contains those instructions. *)

(** [elim tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a sequence that appears nested inside another sequence and inline the elements of that nested sequence in its parent.

  Example: if [tg] points at [{ t2; t3 }] inside [{ t1; { t2; t3 }; t4 }], it "elims" the contents of the inner sequence, producing e.g., [{ t1; t2; t3; t3 }].

  If the sequence appears behind a let, use the sequence result to bind the value:
    if [tg] points at [{ t2; let v = e; t3; v}] inside [{ t1; let x = { t2; let v = e; t3; v }; t4 }], [elim] produces [{ t1; t2; let x = e; t3; t4}].

  If the sequence appears behind other nodes, first perform a Variable.bind and then inlines the generated sequence behind a let.
  In that case, if [res_name] is given, it becomes the new name of the result of the eliminated sequence.
  Else the result of the eliminated sequence is inlined.

(** [apply ~start ~stop ~nb f]: invokes [f mark] where the [mark] is attached to a temporary sequence created
   by [Sequence.intro ~start ~stop ~nb]. This sequence is eliminated immediately afterwards. *)
