(* [delete index nb tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at an instruction,
     [nb] - denotes the number of instructions to delete starting from the targeted trm.

   @correctness: correct if nothing modified by the instruction was observed
   later.
   If the next instructions need an invariant H' and { H } del_instr { H''Â }
   we need both H ==> H' and H'' ==> H'. *)

(* [intro i nb tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at an instruction inside a sequence.
    [mark] -  denotes a mark which add into the generated sub-sequence, in case the user decides to have one.
    [visible] - denotes the visibility of a sequence. This means the that the the sequence is
               used only for internal purposes.                     }
    [nb] - is the number of instructions to be moved inside the sub-sequence.
          If [nb] = 1 means then this transformation is basically the same as intro_on_instr.
          If [nb] is greater than one then it means that the instructions which come right after
            the targeted instruction will be included in the sub-sequence too.
          If [nb] is lwoer than one then it means that the instructions which come before
            the targeted instruction will be included in the sub-sequence too.
    Ex: int main(){     int main(){
        int x = 5;      { int x = 5}
        iny y = 6;      int y = 6;

(* [intro_between ~mark ~label tg_beg tg_end]: this transformation is an advanced version of [intro].

(* [elim tg]: expects the target [tg] to point at a sequence that appears nested inside another sequence,
    e.g., points at [{t2;t3}] inside [{ t1; { t2; t3 }; t4 }]. It "elims" the contents of the inner sequence,

(* [intro_on_instr ~mark ~visible tg]: expecets the target [tg] to point at an instruction,
    then it will wrap a sequence around that instruction.
    [visible] - denotes the visibility of a sequence. This means the that the the sequence is
        used only for internal purposes.
    [mark] - denotes the mark of the sub-sequence. Targeting sequences can be challanging hence having
          them marked before can make the apllication of the transformations easier. *)

(* [partition ~braces blocks tg]: expects the target tg to point at a sequence, this transformations will split that sequence
      into blocks where the sizes of the blocks should be provided by the user.
        [blocks] - denotes the sizes for each block inside the sequence. By default it is empty, otherwise the sum of
          integers inside [blocks] should sum up to the number of instructions of the targeted sequence.
        [braces] - denotes a flag for the visibility of the blocks meaning that this block partition will be meaningful only for
          other transformations that call explicitly the partition transformation. *)
