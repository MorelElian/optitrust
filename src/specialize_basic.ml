    which is used in the delocalize transformation (see to [Variable.delocalize] ),
    then it will replace that call with one of its arguments that satisfies the predicate [select_arg]. *)

      there is already a function generated by the transformation [fundefs], then it will replace that 
      call with a call to the function [spec_name] already defined either by using the transformation [fundefs],
