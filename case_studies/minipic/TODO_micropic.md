(* TODO: cleanup += 1 --> ++ *)
(* check factors != 0 *)
  (* IMPROVEMENTS:
    - nicer open ghosts in input code
    - local name tile: get elem_ty from program / resources
    - bind pointer to particles cell?
    - put 'coeffs' array on stack?
    - allow writing C code for constructing factors, need to parse and put in correct context with local ids
    - FIXME: reparse triggers access normalization
  *)
(* TODO: shorter terminology: prelude and postlude? *)
